This is the code which accompanies the SIGIR 2020 paper Detecting Concept Drift in Medical Triage by Huggard et al.

To replicate the paper's experimental data, you will need to
1. Clone this repo
2. activate virtual env

Contents of repo
 * benchmark_data - the content of the benchmark datastreams
 * benchmark_results - the results of the benchmark experiments
 * referral_data - the content of the MIMIC-derived medical referral datastreams
 * referral_results - the content of the MIMIC-derived medical referral datastreams
 * CDDM_expeirments.ipynb - notebook in which the experiments are run and the data processed

TODO:
 * find the code which generates the MIMIC data stream
 * give credit to [Tornado](https://github.com/alipsgh/tornado)
